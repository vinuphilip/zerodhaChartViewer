# zerodhaChartViewer

###### If you have a requirement to view multiple charts in Zerodha and got tired of tryping and then clicking so many charts, you can use this script to view all your desired charts automatically. Its like click the play button and then just relax and sit and watch.

###### You need to just add your favourite scripts in the links array and just run the script once and sit and enjoy all the charts listed to you in a sequential manner without any click or type

###### The login, password and token can all be automated by entering those values in the scrtip so that these values are passed automatically without you needing to enter. In case token is not static the lines have to commented which actually send the token value and then you need to prompt it once manually at the screen 

###### You can customize your scripts to be viewed by updating the link array and customize your delay between charts by altering your sleep.

###### This is a python script written for chrome hence its expected that you have chrome, python and selenium installed on your machine
